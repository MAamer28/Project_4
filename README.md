# TTC Bus Delays: Past, Present, and Future
### Project 4: by Mohamed Aamer, Urja Dudhwala, Peerapat Phatpanichot

## Abstract
In this research project, data on TTC bus delays was taken from the Open Data Toronto portal and analyzed to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the minute delays of buses on a particular day. 

The project hopes to offer tools to assist the TTC in anticipating days with prolonged delays and therefore let operators mobilize extra resources accordingly.

## Tasks
- Dataset ETL
- Creating a SQL database
- Creating Tableau visuals
- Random Forest machine learning code
- SARIMAX() Time Series machine learning code
- Organizing presentation and Readme
